# Create a project

First, create a project, move to it and initialize Git.
```shell
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository
```


Then, we need to initialize a new Holium project on our file system with the command provisioned by
the CLI.

```shell
$ holium init --no-dvc
Initializing a repository without data version control may lead to commit large files.
Consider using DVC : https://dvc.org/

To track changes in the Holium project, run :

        git add .holium

Initialized Holium repository.
```

This command will have created a `.holium` folder in it that contains all the files related to your 
Holium project. To refer to the structure of a Holium project see [here](../reference/cli/project-structure.md).

By adding that folder to version control we will ease the process of sharing our transformation pipeline
DAG and the different data we will have generated by running it.

```shell
$ git add .holium

$ git commit -m "Holium init"
[main (root-commit) 53f9041] Holium init
```

We are now ready to build our first pipeline.
