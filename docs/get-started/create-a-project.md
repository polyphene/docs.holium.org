# Create a project

First, create a project, move to it and initialize Git.
```shell
$ git init

Initialized empty Git repository
```

After Git we also initialize DVC.
```shell
$ dvc init

Initialized DVC repository.

You can now commit the changes to git.
```

Then, we need to initialize a new Holium project on our file system with the command provisionned by
the CLI.

```shell
$ holium init
To track changes in the Holium project, run :

        dvc add .holium/interplanetary
        git add .holium

Initialized Holium repository.
```

This command will have created a `.holium` folder in it that contains all the files related to your 
Holium project. To refer to the structure of an Holium project see [here](../reference/cli/project-structure.md).

By adding that folder to version control we will ease the process of sharing our transformation pipeline
DAG and the different data we will have generated by running it.

```shell
$ dvc add .holium/interplanetary

$ git add .holium

$ git commit -m "Holium init"

We are now ready to build our first pipeline.
