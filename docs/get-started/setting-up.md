# Setting up

In this tutorial, we will go through the creation of an Holium project that is tested, documented, 
and deployed â€” you can check out the generated documentation for the project we're building [here](TODO_GITHUB_LINK).

This tutorial is geared at first-time users who want detailed instructions on how to go from zero to
a deployed Holium project.

To be able to follow this tutorial you will first need to get the Holium CLI on your machine.

## TODO NEED DOWNLOADS HERE

For this tutorial we will use the [Holium Rust SDK](https://github.com/polyphene/holium-rs-sdk) to 
compile needed Holium modules.
