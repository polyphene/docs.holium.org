# Setting up

In this tutorial, we will go through the creation of an Holium project that is tested, documented, 
and deployed â€” you can check out the generated project from the tutorial [here](https://github.com/polyphene/getting-started).

This tutorial is geared towards first-time users who want detailed instructions on how to go from scratch to
a working Holium project. As we aim to get use to all facets of the Holium CLI we choose a simple use case.

The tutorial data are sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). They represent numbers on
avocado sales in the United States. The goal of our transformation pipeline is to create a data
pipeline to get numbers of avocado type sales for on a given year.

To be able to follow this tutorial you will first need to install Rust on your machine.
Newcomers to the Rust toolchain may find [instructions](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) for its 
installation through a one-line script.

Once Rust is installed we will be able to leverage [`cargo`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) to 
install the Holium CLI. Execute the command:
```shell
$ cargo install holium-cli

    Updating crates.io index
  Downloaded holium-cli v1.0.0-alpha
              ...
  Installing
   Installed package `holium-cli v1.0.0-alpha`
```

Then to proceed in the tutorial we will need two version control tools. 

The first one is [Git](https://git-scm.com/). It will prove useful to version our Holium project and the different pipeline
we build in it. You can find about installation procedure on [their dedicated page](https://git-scm.com/book/fr/v2/D%C3%A9marrage-rapide-Installation-de-Git).

Finally we will install [DVC](https://dvc.org/) to handle versions on the data that we will import to
and export from the Holium Framework. Their [installation page](https://dvc.org/doc/install) contains all necessary steps to access
their CLI.


_Note: For this tutorial we will use the [Holium Rust SDK](https://github.com/polyphene/holium-rs-sdk) to 
compile needed Holium modules._
